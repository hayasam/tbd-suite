# DeepSpeech 2

## Introduction

This folder contains the [_DeepSpeech2_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595) benchmark.
It is developed by [_Baidu_](http://www.baidu.com/).
The local copy is based on example code in MXNet repo. [_example_](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/speech_recognition).
_DeepSpeech2_ is the benchmark on Speech Recognition.
Now this model is removed from MXNet repo

## Prerequisites
* Install sox for converting *.flac files to *.wav
```bash
  sudo apt-get install sox
```
* For setting up DS2 on MXNet, Warp-CTC need to be installed first. Please follow the steps given [here](https://github.com/UofT-EcoSystem/DNN-Training-Suite/tree/master/SpeechRecognition-DeepSpeech2/MXNet/source#install-baidu-warpctc).
