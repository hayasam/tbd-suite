# UnsupervisedLearning-SAGAN

## Introduction

This directory contains benchmarks based on Self-Attention GAN.

GAN is an unsupervised learning model that uses two networks - a generator and a discriminator. As training progresses, the generator attempts to produce increasingly convincing data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between data produced by the generator and data from the original dataset. Self-Attention GAN improves in Self-Attention layer, Spectrum Normalization, and imbalanced learning rate for both generator and discriminator.
